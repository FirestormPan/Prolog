Descriptions of the problems I am solving in each file.

GENERATORS: 
There is a number of generators, each one producing a certain amount of energy. There are also several need points, requiring energy of different ammounts. The goal 
is to match the needs, using the available resources, in the most efficient way. The list of matchings should be saved as an list of statements.

TRANSMITIONS:
A TV station needs to broadcast a number of transmitions. The TV station has a limited bandwidth available(eg 400). Each transmition has: a Duration, 
a required bandwidth, and a cost multiplier. The cost is calculated by multiplying the time of the videos end(time after we start broadcasting), with the cost multiplier.
Some of the transmitions can't be broadcasted together, for other reasons (eg conflicting interests of transmition 1 and 5).
The goal is to broadcaast all transmitions with the lowest cost.
